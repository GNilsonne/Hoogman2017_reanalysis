# Hoogman2017_reanalysis
Data from Hoogman et al. 2017 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2215-0366(17)30049-4) were reanalysed. Files "s_table_2" and "s_table_4" are data presented as tables in the supplementary files to the main paper by Hoogman et al. The script "reanalysis_Hoogman.R" performs mixed-effects meta-analysis on presented estimates per stidy cohors, i.e. without individual participant data, and investigates the effect of adding IQ difference as a covariate.
